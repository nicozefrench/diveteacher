@CURRENT-CONTEXT.md

This rule ensures that `CURRENT-CONTEXT.md` is automatically loaded into the AI Assistant's context at the start of every Cursor session.

**What this provides:**
- 🧠 **Continuity:** AI Assistant remembers what we were working on last session
- 📋 **Active Work:** Current goals and status
- 🎯 **Next Steps:** What needs to happen next
- ⚠️ **Critical Context:** Important decisions and gotchas
- 📊 **System State:** Current versions and agent status

**Purpose:**
This file maintains context between Cursor AI Assistant sessions (development work), NOT for Claude Code (production agents in terminal).

**Usage:**
- Updated continuously during development sessions
- Read automatically by Cursor AI Assistant on startup via `@CURRENT-CONTEXT.md` reference
- Provides seamless continuity between sessions
