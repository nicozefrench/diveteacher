# ðŸ“Š Performance Baseline - Fix #16 Current State
## Measurement Before Fix #17-18 Implementation

**Date:** October 30, 2025, 12:30 CET  
**System State:** Fix #16 deployed (continuous polling for completed docs)  
**Purpose:** Establish baseline to compare after Fix #17-18

---

## Baseline Measurements (To Be Filled During User Test)

### Timing Metrics

- **Upload Start:** `[TO BE MEASURED]`
- **Status = 'completed' (Backend):** `[TO BE MEASURED]`
- **Metrics Displayed in UI:** `[NEVER - Bug #19]`
- **React Hooks Error Appears:** `[TO BE MEASURED]`
- **UI Crashes (Gray Screen):** `[TO BE MEASURED]`

**Expected from Test Run #12:**
- Processing duration: ~246 seconds
- UI shows empty metrics ("â€”") at completion
- React Hooks error after ~1-2 minutes
- Complete UI crash (gray screen)

### Console Errors

**Expected from Test Run #12:**
```
Warning: React has detected a change in the order of Hooks called by Neo4jSnapshot.
Error: Rendered more hooks than during the previous render.
```

### Memory Usage

- **At Start:** `[TO BE MEASURED]`
- **After 5 min polling:** `[TO BE MEASURED]`
- **Memory Leak:** `[TO BE DETERMINED]`

## Post-Fix Comparison (To Be Updated After Fix #17-18)

### Expected Results After Fix

**Bug #18 (React Hooks):**
- âœ… NO React Hooks errors in console
- âœ… NO UI crash
- âœ… Neo4j tab displays without issues

**Bug #19 (Metrics Display):**
- âœ… Metrics display within 2 seconds of completion
- âœ… "73" for Entities (not "â€”")
- âœ… "78" for Relations (not "â€”")
- âœ… Performance badge shows time (not "Processing...")

**Performance:**
- âœ… No memory leaks after 5 min
- âœ… Polling continues without performance degradation
- âœ… Real-time progress (Fix #11) still works

**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ BASELINE DEFINED - Waiting for user test to fill measurements
