## üö® Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ‚ùå MISTAKE #1: Using "prep e2e" for Production

```
User: "prep e2e" (before uploading 100 PDFs)
Result: ‚ö†Ô∏è  ALL DATA DELETED!

‚úÖ CORRECT:
User: "prep ingestion"
Result: ‚úÖ Data preserved, ready for uploads
```

---

### ‚ùå MISTAKE #2: Not Monitoring During Batch

```
User: (uploads 100 PDFs without monitoring)
Result: ‚ö†Ô∏è  No visibility, can't debug issues

‚úÖ CORRECT:
User: "monitor queue" (in separate terminal)
Result: ‚úÖ Real-time status, see progress
```

---

### ‚ùå MISTAKE #3: Forgetting Database State

```
User: "prep e2e" then "monitor queue"
Agent: Queue shows 0 completed (DB was cleaned)
User: Confused why old data is gone

‚úÖ REMEMBER:
"prep e2e" = Clean slate (0 nodes)
"prep ingestion" = Keep data (693 nodes)
```

---

## üí° Tips & Best Practices

### Tip #1: Check Database Before Cleanup

```
User: "show me neo4j stats"
Agent: 693 nodes, 1960 relationships

User: "prep e2e" ‚Üê Now you know you'll lose 693 nodes
```

---

### Tip #2: Use Quiet Mode for Scripts

```
User: "prep ingestion quiet"
Agent: ./scripts/init-e2e-test.sh --skip-cleanup --quiet
# ‚Üí Minimal output, just status checks
```

---

### Tip #3: Monitor Queue During Large Batches

```
User: "prep ingestion"
User: "monitor queue"
# ‚Üí Open in separate terminal
# ‚Üí Upload 100 PDFs
# ‚Üí Watch queue process them one by one
```

---

---

## üîÑ State Management

### Database States

**State A: Empty (After "prep e2e")**
```
Nodes: 0
Relationships: 0
Use: E2E testing, clean validation
```

**State B: Populated (After "prep ingestion")**
```
Nodes: 693+ (preserved)
Relationships: 1960+ (preserved)
Use: Production ingestion, additive sessions
```

**State C: Growing (During 100 PDF batch)**
```
Nodes: 693 ‚Üí 1500+ (growing)
Relationships: 1960 ‚Üí 5000+ (growing)
Use: Knowledge graph expansion
```

## ‚úÖ Validation

### How to Verify System is Ready

**After "prep e2e":**
```
Check output shows:
‚úÖ Database: 0 nodes, 0 relationships
‚úÖ ARIA Chunker: RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter ready
‚úÖ DocumentQueue: Ready (empty, idle)
‚úÖ Mode: E2E TESTING
```

**After "prep ingestion":**
```
Check output shows:
‚úÖ Database: 693 nodes, 1960 relationships (preserved)
‚úÖ ARIA Chunker: RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter ready
‚úÖ DocumentQueue: Ready (empty, idle)
‚úÖ Mode: PRODUCTION INGESTION (additive)
```

## üöÄ Production Ingestion Checklist

**Before starting 100 PDF batch:**

- [ ] Say: "prep ingestion"
- [ ] Verify: Database preserved (693+ nodes shown)
- [ ] Verify: ARIA Chunker ready (3000 tokens/chunk)
- [ ] Verify: DocumentQueue idle (0 queued)
- [ ] Open: `./scripts/monitor-queue.sh` in Terminal 1
- [ ] Open: `./scripts/monitor_ingestion.sh` in Terminal 2
- [ ] Upload: All 100 PDFs (queue will process sequentially)
- [ ] Wait: ~6.5 hours (queue finishes automatically)
- [ ] Verify: 100% success rate in queue monitor
