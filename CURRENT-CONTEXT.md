# CURRENT CONTEXT - RAG Knowledge Graph Project

**Last Updated:** October 26, 2025  
**Project:** RAG Knowledge Graph Starter  
**Repository:** https://github.com/nicozefrench/rag-knowledge-graph-starter.git

---

## 📍 Current Status

**Phase:** Initial Setup & Review  
**Session:** 1  
**Environment:** macOS (darwin 24.6.0)

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

### What This Is
A production-ready boilerplate for building intelligent document Q&A applications using:
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** for accurate answers
- **Neo4j + Graphiti** for knowledge graph extraction
- **LLM Agnostic** architecture (Ollama/Claude/OpenAI)
- **React + FastAPI** full-stack application
- **Docker** deployment with Vercel (frontend) + DigitalOcean (backend)

### Key Capabilities
1. Upload PDF/PPT documents → Auto-process → Knowledge Graph
2. Natural language queries → Context retrieval → Streaming LLM responses
3. No hallucinations (answers only from uploaded documents)
4. Modern UI with real-time progress and streaming

## 🎯 Next Steps (Prioritized)

### Immediate Tasks
1. [ ] Check if `.env` file exists, if not create from `.env.template`
2. [ ] Review `.env.template` to understand required configuration
3. [ ] Verify Docker and Docker Compose are installed
4. [ ] List directory structure to see what files are present
5. [ ] Review backend structure (FastAPI, core logic)
6. [ ] Review frontend structure (React components)

### Setup Tasks (After Initial Review)
1. [ ] Configure `.env` file with necessary credentials
2. [ ] Start Docker services (`docker-compose.dev.yml`)
3. [ ] Pull Ollama model (llama3:8b)
4. [ ] Verify all services are running
5. [ ] Test document upload flow
6. [ ] Test query/chat functionality

### Development Tasks (Future)
1. [ ] Customize UI/branding if needed
2. [ ] Add any specific document types
3. [ ] Configure external LLM if not using Ollama
4. [ ] Set up Sentry monitoring
5. [ ] Deploy to production (Vercel + DigitalOcean)

## 🔑 Key Configuration Files

### `.env.template` (Not Yet Reviewed)
**Purpose:** Template for environment variables  
**Critical Settings:**
- LLM_PROVIDER (ollama/claude/openai)
- NEO4J_PASSWORD
- OLLAMA_MODEL
- API URLs and ports

### `docker-compose.dev.yml`
**Purpose:** Local development orchestration  
**Services:**
- Backend (FastAPI)
- Neo4j (Graph database)
- Ollama (LLM server)
- Frontend (React dev server)

---

## 💡 Important Decisions & Notes

### Technology Choices
- **LLM:** Will use Ollama (local) for privacy and cost-effectiveness
- **Frontend Deployment:** Vercel (free tier, CDN)
- **Backend Deployment:** DigitalOcean ($12-40/month)
- **Database:** Neo4j for knowledge graph storage

### Key Features to Remember
1. **LLM Agnostic:** Can switch providers via environment variable
2. **Streaming Responses:** Real-time token delivery for better UX
3. **No Hallucinations:** Answers only from ingested documents
4. **Document Processing:** Dockling (PDF→Markdown) → Graphiti (→Neo4j)

## 🎓 Learning Notes

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- Combines retrieval (from knowledge base) + generation (LLM)
- Prevents hallucinations by grounding responses in real data
- Flow: Query → Retrieve Context → Augment Prompt → Generate Answer

### Knowledge Graphs
- Entities (nodes) + Relationships (edges)
- Better than vector search for structured knowledge
- Cypher query language for Neo4j
- Graphiti automates entity/relationship extraction

### Document Processing Pipeline
```
PDF/PPT → Dockling (Markdown) → Graphiti (Entities/Relations) → Neo4j (Graph)
```
